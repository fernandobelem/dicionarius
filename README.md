# dicionarius
Meteor Application 

Application developed to test stuff about MeteorJS, which is an amazing language.

My goal was to test some of the event orientation tech embed within the language which I've accomplished developing a simple CRUD of text and image upload.

I also made a chat window for users that want to type anything that comes in mind !
