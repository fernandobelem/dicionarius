# Dicionarius

Meteor Application 

Application developed to test learn a little about MeteorJS, which is an amazing language.

My goal was to test some of the event orientation tech embed within the language which I've accomplished developing a simple CRUD of text and image upload.

I also made a chat window for users that want to type anything that comes in mind !

###

The Dicionarius application is an dictionary of words or phrases(ohrly?) in pt_BR which the main goal is to store funny/strange/uncommon words or even jokes that only exists or have some meaning in certain contexts for certain people ! 

So yea, I know ! It can sound ridiculous and meaningless for most of people !
